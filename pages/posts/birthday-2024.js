          Happy 25th Birthday my Love, my Fianc√©, my future, <b>my forever</b>‚ôæÔ∏è,<br/>
          my one and only Viola Dheena Pongajow
        </p>

        <p>
          Full disclosure, I did write that this website should be receiving it's animation-filed pdate after 2023, but seems like time just comes by
          too fast, I am really sorry for this same-cosmetic website in 2024. And also, this year's birthday message may mostly talk about us and our plans because
          <br></br><b>I pop the question OMG!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          As I'm writing this, it is still a mystery wether  you are going to celebrate this year's birthday with me or not(Update: you did!), whatever that is, 
          one thing for sure, we are going to celebrate your birthday as a one-step closer coupleüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®. For the first time in your many birthdays, I pronouce
          you as someone's Fianc√©! <br/>In this case, <b>Viola is Eldio's Fianc√©!!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Counting the last hours of Viola's Birthday, we are faced with <b>adulting</b> problems. Starting from each other's work, fellow, our future,
          and one in particular is that a planed date needs to be canceled because of Eldio's work. A pre-celebration of Viola's Birthday where we talk 
          about our plans, our future, our preparations, our family, along with many others has to be halted due to a unforeseen circumsatances. Fortunately, (Hopefully) We were able to talk out
          of it but both of us cant seem to hide the dissapointment. "Loving each other so much is not quite enough" I said, followed by "Why is it so hard to unite" said Viola.
          Grimm Night Indeed.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Long Drive and Night followed after I drove Viola to Hotel Rogers. But dear, I cant help to think that how funny and cute we are right now dealing with these
          problems by <b>our</b> future self. I cant help myself for smiling!! It must be even greater and harder problems we would already been through together to think that
          this is just something to laught about. Notice that I use "us", "our", "together" when I'm describing the future? That's because you are my future babee, there's no other way,
          there is no other future.<br/>JUST YOU.
        </p>

        <p>
          I cant help it, this birthday wish just turn into a love letter! Just like your writing in 2014, you know, the "Viola sedang jatung cinta ..." HEHEHEHEHEHEH
